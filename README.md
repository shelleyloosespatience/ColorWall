## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust (1.70.0 or higher)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- A Spotify account
- Spotify API credentials (see [Spotify Setup](#spotify-setup))

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/laxenta/spotify-sync-CLI
cd spotify-sync-CLI

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available at
./target/release/spotify-sync
```

## Spotify Setup

1. Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create App"
4. Fill in the application details:
   - App name: `spotify-sync` (or any name you prefer)
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8888/callback`
   - Website: (optional)
   - Description: (optional)
5. After creating the app, you'll see your:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret (click "Show Client Secret" to reveal)
6. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

## Usage

### Logging In to Accounts

```bash
# Log in to your source account (the one you want to copy from)
spotify-sync login source

# Log in to your target account (the one you want to copy to)
spotify-sync login target
```

### Listing Connected Accounts

```bash
spotify-sync list
```

### Previewing Transfer

```bash
# See what will be transferred from the source account
spotify-sync preview source
```

### Performing the Transfer

```bash
# Transfer everything from source to target account
spotify-sync transfer source target
```

## How It Works

The application follows this process:

1. **Authentication**
   - Uses Spotify's OAuth 2.0 flow
   - Opens your browser for login
   - Securely stores tokens in `~/.spotify-sync/tokens.json`

2. **Library Analysis**
   - Scans source account for:
     - Liked songs
     - Playlists
     - Albums

3. **Transfer Process**
   - Copies liked songs
   - Creates new playlists in target account
   - Preserves playlist metadata (names, descriptions, public/private status)
   - Copies all tracks to new playlists
   - Saves albums to target library

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Shows real-time progress bars
   - Displays item counts and estimated time remaining
   - Provides clear success/failure feedback
